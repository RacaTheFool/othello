# Overview

I created this Rust program for the user[s] to play Othello. The full explaination of how the game works can be found at the Reversi Wiki link.

I did this project to familiarize myself with the Rust language. Rust was much more difficult for me to understand than I originally thought it would be, as even receiving user input was more difficult than other languages. Some colleagues of mine showed my the link for the read!() function (found under Useful Websites) that made getting user input significantly easier. I also ran into a timeline error that I had to find a roundabout way to work around. Overall, I feel satisfied with my understanding of the basics of the language now.

# Future Work

* Make the game work on a browser or in an app
* Create a database to track players and their wins/losses
* See if there is a better way to check all directions for a capture
